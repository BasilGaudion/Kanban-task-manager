# Kanban task manager website

![Design preview for the Kanban task manager website](./preview.jpg)

## Introduction 🎉

Welcome to my Kanban task manager website project! This project was built as a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It's a web application that lets you manage tasks using a drag-and-drop system. Ce défi a demander beaucoup de nouvelles compétences que j'ai aquises durant le développement de celui-ci, en particulier Typescript. This website has been developed in mobile first.

## Technologies Used 💻

### Front-end :

- React.js
- SASS
- Typescript

### Back-end :

- Node JS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose


## Features 🛍

Users visiting the website can:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- Edit boards, columns, tasks and their subtasks.
- Register and log on to the site with password database encryption.
- Automatically save every change
- Change their tasks between columns with a drag-and-drop system.
- Add colors to columns and spots to quickly identify what needs to be done and what has already been done.
